# UX Audit - Based on 100+ Dev Tool Landing Pages Study

## Current Issues

### 1. **Too Much Visual Noise**
- Purple/pink glow effects everywhere
- Animated gradients competing for attention
- No clear focal point

### 2. **Missing Critical Elements**
- ❌ No product screenshot in hero
- ❌ No social proof section after hero (logos/testimonials)
- ❌ No integration badges prominently displayed
- ❌ Stats are just numbers (not visual)

### 3. **Color Scheme Issues**
- Purple + Pink = too "gamer"/consumer
- Need more neutral, professional base
- Use color strategically for CTAs only

## Best Practices from Study

### Hero Section
✅ Centered composition
✅ Static or animated product shot (screenshot/GIF)
✅ Engaging CTA (one primary, one secondary)
✅ Clean, minimal design

### After Hero: Social Proof
✅ Client logos OR testimonials
✅ Right after hero section
✅ Auto-scrolling carousel if many logos
✅ "Trusted by" or "Used by" heading

### Integrations/Compatibility
✅ Block with logos of services it works with
✅ Signals maturity
✅ Makes it easy to see if tool fits their stack

### Color Strategy
- **Base**: Neutral (slate/gray)
- **Text**: High contrast white/gray
- **Accent**: One brand color for CTAs
- **Secondary**: Subtle blue for info

### Typography
- **Headlines**: Bold, large, high contrast
- **Body**: Easy to read, good line height
- **CTAs**: Action-oriented, benefit-driven

## Fixes Needed

1. Remove all glow/shadow effects except on CTAs
2. Add product screenshot to hero
3. Add "Trusted by developers" section after hero
4. Change base colors to neutral slate
5. Make CTAs pop with single brand color
6. Simplify stats (remove fancy cards)
7. Add framework/IDE logos section
